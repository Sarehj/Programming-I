# Arithmetic with strings

Perform arithmetic operations on natural numbers expressed as a character string

Two natural numbers1 are given as character strings of any length.
The problem is to perform various arithmetic operations on these numbers.
In each operation one must examine the character strings digit by digit and
determine the next digit in the result. Thus a new character string is created,
representing the result of the operation.
