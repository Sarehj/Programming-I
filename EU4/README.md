# An abstract model of a polyline

### A planar polyline
A polyline is a geometrical figure consisting of a series of connected line segments (edges). The endpoints of these line segments are the vertices of the polyline. A polyline is defined by its vertices, its colour, and its width. An empty polyline has no edges.
The vertices, colour, width and length of a polyline can be obtained. Colour and width can be modified. The shape of a polyline changes when its sequence of vertices is modified. One can add a new vertex to the polyline â€” either at the end or in front of a named vertex. It is also possible to remove a named vertex.
One can iterate over a polyline; the vertices can be visited and used in sequence.
An abstract model of a polyline is to be created; an interface class called Polyline.
