# Temperature readings

Processing measurement data

Temperature readings are taken in one and the same place for a couple of weeks.
The readings are taken regularly â€” the same number of readings each week.
At the end of the measurement period the collected data is to be processed:
for each week the least, the greatest and the average temperature is to be
determined. The least, greatest and average temperature for the whole period
is also to be computed.
